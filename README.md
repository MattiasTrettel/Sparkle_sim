This repository contains the code related to the document "Sparkle_Communication_Protocol_Sim", it is a 
comprehensive report on how an inspired communication system was developed,
with various simplifications, to what will be in place between SPaRKLE and Space Rider and has the objective of functioning
as a guide for the step-by-step replication of this system. Next we will start modifying the application
in such a way as to satisfy the relevant requirements present in the “SR RM Payloads SW IRD” document or file
“TASI-SR-SRS-X-11-IRD-0004_v1_E-Sgn.pdf”.
